# python-api-challenge
## Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

| Parts | Background | Topics Covered |
| ----------- | ----------- | :----------- |
| WeatherPy | In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the CitiPy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities. | Topic 1 <br>Topic 2 <br>Topic 3 <br>Topic 2 <br>Topic 3 <br>Topic 2 <br>Topic 3 |
| VacationPy | In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API. Your main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations. | Topic 1 <br>Topic 2 <br>Topic 3 <br>Topic 2 <br>Topic 3 <br>Topic 2 <br>Topic 3 |
